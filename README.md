#### _This is a Rails API built with Ruby 2.4.1 and Rails 5.1.2.  It contains data about national and state parks.  July 21, 2017_

#### By _**Asia Kane**_

## Description

This is an API that includes data for national and state parks.  It features Serialization to return parks and activities nested within each park.  The application uses model scopes to return many custom endpoints.

Park information includes:
- name
- square mileage
- state
- date founded
- fauna
- activities

Endpoints (See sample Postman calls below):
- Endpoints for GET requests for Parks and Activities
- Endpoints for POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE requests for Parks and activities
- Endpoints to allow users to search by park name, state, square miles, fauna, and year.
- An endpoint that randomly returns a park.
- An Endpoint that orders the parks by oldest date (date founded).

This API includes:
- Exception Handling for Errors and Success messages.
- Testing with request specs.
- Serialization (Active_Model_Serializers Gem) to return parks in JSON object form including nested Activities for each park.
